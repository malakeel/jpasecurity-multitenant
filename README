TODO:

1- Need to make the config read using InputStream getClass().getResourceAsStream(), to read it from the jar.

2- Find a way to pass the tenant ID to the EntityManger. ThreadLocal : SAFE??? 

3- Read the configuration to avoid repeating properties for each tenant. In case we have more than 2 tenants, it will
    be a source of error. Normally, we use the same DBMS so the same driver. Properties that changes are 
        - connection url
        - user name
        - password 
    Everything else should be the same to avoid erros. 

4- Make the tests pass and write additional unit tests for more peristence classes.
